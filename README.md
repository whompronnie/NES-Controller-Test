# NES-Controller-Test
A small app that tests the Player 1 NES controller, along with some background and sprite functions.

To compile, simply double-click controllertest.bat, and it will (or should) overwrite the current NES file using the NESASM3 compiler.

The original files for NESASM3 can be found at http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/
